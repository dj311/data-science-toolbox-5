# Data Science Toolbox 4

There is a Jupyter notebook containing the practical part of this report at `./project/report.ipynb`. This can be downloaded and run locally, or within Google Colab.

## Running locally
We've frozen our dependencies in `requirements.txt`, so the following should get a local installation up and running:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running with Google Colab
Following [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sydneyvert/dst4/blob/master/project/report.ipynb) will open the main report in colab. Then run the following in a code cell:

```
!pip install cleverhans
```

(this is commented out in the top code cell). The rest of our requirements come pre-installed.
